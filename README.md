# Personal Portfolio Website - Farahnaz Faryan

## ðŸŒŸ Theme & Inspiration  
This project was created with my own creative design, without following any templates. The goal was to build a personal portfolio that reflects who I am as an artist, designer, and cultural contributor.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Highlights  
- Built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
- Includes six main sections: **Home**, **About Me**, **My Services**, **My Skills**, **My Projects**, and **Contact Me**.  
- Clean and elegant layout designed from scratch to match my personal style.

## ðŸš§ Challenges Faced  
- Designing everything from zero without templates required extra planning and attention to detail.  
- Creating a responsive layout with only HTML and CSS took several rounds of testing and adjustments.
